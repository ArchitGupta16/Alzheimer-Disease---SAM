# Alzheimer-Disease-Detection

This repository contains all resources for the detection and analysis of Alzheimer's disease using the AD dataset. We have built a novel model from scratch which helps to resolve class imblance problems. We provide three analysis - the ablation, comparison with existing models and a 5 fold validation experimental setup.

- Ablation consists of multiple experiments which lead to our final model
- Comparison with existing models consists of pretrained as well models implemented from papers.
- The 5 fold setup helps us test the stability of the model
